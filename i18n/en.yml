        configure:
            desc: Configure AWS
            long_desc: |
                Configure  AWS  profiles. If this command is run with no arguments,
                you will be prompted for configuration values such as your  AWS  Access
                Key  Id  and you AWS Secret Access Key.  You can configure a named pro-
                file using the --profile argument.  If your config file does not  exist
                (the default location is ~/.aws/config), the AWS CLI will create it for
                you.  To keep an existing value, hit enter when prompted for the value.
                When  you  are prompted for information, the current value will be dis-
                played in [brackets].  If the config item has no value, it be displayed
                as  [None].  Note that the configure command only work with values from
                the config file.  It does not use any configuration values  from  envi-
                ronment variables or the IAM role.

                Note:  The  values  you  provide  for the AWS Access Key ID and the AWS
                Secret Access Key will be written to your keyring backend.
